#### 3.1.1 alias

------

Without arguments, `alias` prints the list of aliases on the standard output. If arguments are supplied, an alias is defined for each name whose value is given. If no value is given, the name and value of the alias is printed.

#### 3.1.2 bg

------

Resume each suspended job in the background, as if it had been started with &.

[Return to top](#builtins).

#### 3.1.3 cd

------

Change the current working directory to `directory`. If `directory` is not supplied, the value of the `HOME` shell variable is used.

##### 3.1.3.1 Options

`-L`: symbolic links in directory are resolved after `cd` processes an instance of ‘`..`’ in directory.

`-P`: not follow symbolic links: symbolic links are resolved while `cd` is traversing `directory` and before processing an instance of ‘`..`’ in directory.

[Return to top](#builtins).

#### 3.1.4 echo

------

Outputs it's args to stdout, separated by spaces, followed by a newline. The return status is always 0.

[Return to top](#builtins).

#### 3.1.5 env

------

Set the environment for command invocation.

##### 3.1.5.1 Options

`-i`: Invoke utility with exactly the environment specified by the arguments; the inherited environment shall be ignored completely.

[Return to top](#builtins).

#### 3.1.6 exit [n]

------

Shall cause the shell to exit with the exit status specified by the unsigned decimal integer n.

[Return to top](#builtins).

#### 3.1.7 export

------

Marks an environment variable to be exported with any newly forked child processes and thus it allows a child process to inherit all marked variables.

##### 3.1.7.1 Options

`-p`: List of all names that are exported in the current shell.

[Return to top](#builtins).

#### 3.1.8 false

------

Do nothing, returning a non-zero (false) exit status.

[Return to top](#builtins).

#### 3.1.9 fg

------

Put each specified job in the background, or the current job if none is specified.

[Return to top](#builtins).

#### 3.1.10 hash

------

Determine and remember the full pathname of each commandname. If no arguments are given, display information about remembered command locations.

#### 3.1.10.1 Options

`-r`: Forget all remembered locations.

[Return to top](#builtins).

#### 3.1.11 history

------

With no options, display the history list with line numbers.

##### 3.1.11.1 Options

`-c`: Clear the history list.

`-d [offset]`: Delete the history entry at position `offset`. `offset` should be specified as it appears when the history is displayed.

[Return to top](#builtins).

#### 3.1.12 jobs

------

The first form lists the active jobs.

##### 3.1.12.1 Options

#### 3.1.13 set

------

Change the value of a shell option and set the positional parameters, or display the names and values of shell variables.

#### 3.1.14 test

------

Evaluate a conditional expression.
