Hi. I'm fond of computers and new technologies ever since my childhood. 

I have a strong experience (about 10 years) in different departments of IT.

Since 2017 I am a student at the 42-Paris school and I'm looking for a new job opportunity where I can put my knowledge to word and learn new things. 

This webpage introduces you to some of my projects, I hope you enjoy reading about them.
